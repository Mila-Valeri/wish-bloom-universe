# Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Pre-deployment Checklist Completed

### 1. Project Structure Fixed
- ✅ Separate client folder with independent package.json
- ✅ index.html located in client root (not nested)
- ✅ All dependencies moved to production dependencies
- ✅ Build tools (Tailwind, PostCSS, Vite) in dependencies

### 2. Build Configuration Optimized
- ✅ `base: './'` added to vite.config.ts for relative paths
- ✅ Tailwind content paths corrected: `["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"]`
- ✅ Manual chunks configured for better performance
- ✅ Build tested successfully (9.2s build time)

### 3. Asset Paths Fixed
- ✅ All placeholder images use relative paths: `./placeholder.svg`
- ✅ CSS animations use proper relative references
- ✅ No absolute paths that would break on Vercel

### 4. Vercel Configuration
- ✅ vercel.json created with proper SPA routing
- ✅ Asset caching headers configured
- ✅ Build output optimized with code splitting

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, the site should display:
- ✅ Proper Tailwind styling (no layout issues)
